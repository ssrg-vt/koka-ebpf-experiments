# Namespace
- Namespaces are a feature of the Linux kernel that partition kernel resources such that 
  one set of processes sees one set of resources, while another set of processes sees a different set of resources.
- In Linux, a namespace is a feature that allows processes to use the system resources 
  they need but separately from other processes. 
- A namespace is a way to virtualize a global system resource such that a process that needs 
  it operates in an isolated instance of that resource.
